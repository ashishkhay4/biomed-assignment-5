\section*{ 1 .INTRODUCTION :}
These include smart phones, Tablet PCs, Touch screens, digital ink, voice recognition, Electronic Health Records (EHRs), Health Information Exchange (HIE), Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN), Personal Health Records (PHRs), patient portals, Nanomedicine, genome-based personalized medicine, Geographical.


The term commonly refers to technologies that are currently developing, or that are expected to be available within the next five to ten years, and is usually reserved for technologies that are creating, or are expected to create, significant social or economic effects.

\section*{ 2 .Global Healthcare: }
The healthcare sector of today benefits immensely from technological advancements. Emerging technologies are helping develop newer, better treatments while alleviating cost burdens. Some technologies are yet to be explored to their full potential, but have still brought about a massive shift in the sector. Innovations such as artificial intelligence and robotics are completely changing the landscape, ushering in a new future for healthcare.

\section*{ 3 .Five Emerging Technologies Changing the Landscape.}
 1 .Portable Monitors.
  
 2 .Smart Beds.
  
 3 .Wearable Devices. 
 
 4 .Electronic Health Records.
  
 5 .Centralized Command Centers.
 
\section*{ 4 . Advantage :}
 IT enables health practitioners to store and retrieve data relating to a patient's health records. It also enhances the communication of patient information through a legible format that anyone can use. As a result, it reduces the chance of medication errors. 
 

IT has helped healthcare professionals track patient's records easily and securely. A medical professional can add pharmacy records, X-rays, test results, and even vital signs to the virtual chart that is easy to read, share, and check against other records.

\section*{ 5 . Conclusion :} 
 we need a healthy lifestyle to build up a healthy immune system and to avoid disease. Here, “maintain” means a healthy immune system to protect your body. To maintain body immunity, We mentioned 3-features-method before First is nutrients. We should eat a variety of food and keep a balanced diet.That day is not far away when much of the health-related encounters will be
conducted “virtually” using telemedicine technology, ultimately culminating in a
situation where this mode is the one of choice rather than of exception.
Telemedicine is an exciting technology and continues to hold the promise of
being truly transformational in terms of healthcare delivery to everyone’s benefit.
As the population continues to grow at a rate faster than the concomitant growth in
the number of available qualified clinicians and facilities (institutional beds, investigation laboratories, day-care centres, etc.
